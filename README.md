# Snix-Snax Recipe Club

Snacks  are a staple for lunch-boxes, hikes and TV-time, and now they are important for working from home. Finding snack recipes  and new ideas for snacks, either online or in cookbooks can be time consuming and shop-bought snacks are often full of sugar, artificial colours or additives

. Snix-Snax Recipe Club  provides users with a never-ending flow of new snack ideas and recipes from club members. 

**Users of  the SnixSnax site**  can register to  share their favourite snack recipes and  create their own library of favourites ( called a Recipe Box) they can  use and store other people's recipes, watch how to videos and buy cookbooks and cooking tools.
The snacks are categorised under several popular headings - Sweet, Savoury, Gluten- Free, Kids and Popular. 

**Owners of the SnixSnax  site** have several opportunities for monetization
Commission can be earned as an amazon.com associate from advertising snack recipe books  or cookware 
Commission can also be earned from adding an ingredient shopping list for popular supermarkets ( Tesco, Ocado Sainsburys) so that users can quickly send a shopping request for the ingredients that they are missing

To monetize the site so that users will purchase goods or take actions that create commission for the site owner. 

 To have a separate  admin-only section on the site for  team members  to edit or add categories etc.   



## UX

### **User Stories**

- As a mother, I want to have a source of  healthy snack ideas, for my kids' lunch boxes 
- As  a hiker I want crunchy or easily packed snacks that won't get soggy when I am carrying them all day.
- I have to work from home  I want low calorie snacks that I can snack on during the day. 
- I want good  ideas for  sweet and savoury snacks for a childrens birthday party 
- As a user, I have some great recipes for snacks and I want to see them online but I don't have a blog or my own website 



#### **Strategy**

The primary function of the SnixSnax  site is to persuade users that they will receive valuable information in exchange for registering and using the site. If the  user goal is achieved,  the site-owner goal will  be met, that is to have users return many times so they can shop on site  and the site-owner earn commission from advertising.

#### **Scope**

The content and layout of the website is  to establish a means for the site owner to maintain an ongoing connection with users of the website, online ads are effective but a user has to see an advert several times before the site user makes a purchase. 
The SnixSnax recipe Club  encourages users to return frequently - it serves as a recipe repository and allows users to  add their own favourite recipes and to see what other users are adding to the site. 



#### **Structure**

The  Home page for SnixSnax Recipe Club is a simple landing page with a navigation bar and links for the user to Register or Signup to the site or to login if they are already registered.
 It is assumed a user will spend a  short time looking at the content
 The  search bar is prominent on the Home Page so that the user can find recipes quickly and only the most recent recipes that have been submitted are displayed.

A user is likely to spend  time on the site on

-  their Recipe Box page where they can view their collection of recipes 
-   on their Add Recipe Page where they can add recipes .

The monetization of the Home page is important because the user will not spend much time here, so every item must serve some function. - videos are a good way to catch the interest of a user and a selection is presented 




#### **Skeleton**

- Wireframes 

  

##### **Surface**

The appearance of the site is very important, if the site doesn't appear professional and appealing then the user may not go further and become a  regular user.
 The website is the shop- window for the site owner. 
There has to be a balance between content to attract users to register and use the site regularly and monetization.

#### Features Left to Implement
- Add a BuyOnline option to the ingredients section for users that will earn commission for the site- owner

It is possible to earn commission from online supermarkets such as Tesco, Ocado and Sainsbury. The option to click and collect could be added to the recipe ingredients section so that missing ingredients for a recipe can be added to an online order that goes to the supermarket 

- Add a print or email option to the add recipe section so the user can easily print or share the recipe   
- Advertise and sell kitchen tools and aprons and mugs with the brand logo 
- Advertise and sell gift items such as hampers , items can be drop shipped from Amazon and commission earned as an Amazon associate.

- **Live Chat** so that users can ask questions and get them answered without delay
- **Remarketing pixels** so that the company can remind the visitor that they visited the site



#### Technologies Used

​        CSS

-  The project uses Cascading Style Sheets (*CSS*) as a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to the web documents 

​       HTML 

- The project uses Hypertext Markup Language (**HTML**) which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

​       [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- The project uses Heroku to deploy the site and to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.     

​       [Python + Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 

-  The project uses **Flask** as a lightweight WSGI  ( *Web Server Gateway Interface*) web application framework . It contains Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular *Python* web application frameworks

​       [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- the project uses  MongoDB to store the data required for the project. MongoDB is a noSQL database which stores data in JSON format.

​       [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 

- 

    the project uses MaterializeCSS framework as a source of easy to use elements to  simplify the development process 

    

    [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

    ## Security
    
    User Authorization and Authentication
    
    Flask uses Werkzeug for security features and the SnixSnax site makes use of the the standard built – in methods provided
     generate_password_hash  and check_password_hash 
    
     hashing passwords means that a users pw is converted into another string which is one-way and practically impossible to reverse and for additional security it will then salt that string with random data. This provides basic but robust security to protect a users registration information


​    


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.



For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Appearance and operation of  project  on different browsers and screen sizes.

### **Bugs /Problems during project development**** 

 file app.py Line 64  Linting error  that will not go away 
Linting errors on each template because the doctype is missing 



## Deployment

SnixSnax Recipe Club app used  [Heroku.com](www.heroku.com) for deployment from the development version in GitHub  

The automatic deployment option on Heroku was used as follows :

1. The github repository must be named and Heroku authorized

2. Go to  Heroku settings, and then to Reveal config vars and  enter the  IP, PORT , SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME with values  so that Heroku has access to them.(this is necessary because these variables are hidden in our code and Heroku has to be able to read them) 

3.   Ensure that all files including Procfile and requirements.txt  are pushed to git so  the development version is up to date 

    4.When all updates to GitHub are complete simply click "automatic deployment "

4. [It]() is also possible to use the manual  deployment option and select "master "

5. When the app is deployed  it will say "Your app was successfully deployed" and then you can click view 
    to view the app 

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
