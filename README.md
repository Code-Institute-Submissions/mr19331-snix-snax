# Snix-Snax Recipe Club

Snacks  are a staple for lunch-boxes, hikes and TV-time, and now they are important for working from home. Finding snack recipes  and new ideas for snacks, either online or in cookbooks can be time consuming and shop-bought snacks are often full of sugar, artificial colours or additives

. Snix-Snax Recipe Club  provides users with a never-ending flow of new snack ideas and recipes from club members. 

**Users of  the SnixSnax site**  can register to  share their favourite snack recipes and  create their own library of favourites ( called a Recipe Box) they can  use and store other people's recipes, watch how to videos and buy cookbooks and cooking tools.
The snacks are categorised under several popular headings - Sweet, Savoury, Gluten- Free, Kids and Popular. 

**Owners of the SnixSnax  site** have several opportunities for monetization
Commission can be earned as an amazon.com associate from advertising snack recipe books  or cookware 
Commission can also be earned from adding an ingredient shopping list for popular supermarkets ( Tesco, Ocado Sainsburys) so that users can quickly send a shopping request for the ingredients that they are missing

## UX

### **User Stories**

​          **As a new /first time  site user** 

​       I want to understand what  information this site is offering  immediately 

- I expect to be able to access the information that I want easily using conventional  image and link clicking methods
- I want to be able to access categories of recipes to save me time,  as well as searching by name
- I want to be able to visit the site easily on my phone and tablet as well as desktop
- I  don't want to be spammed because I have visited the site 
-  I don't want to be forced sign up for anything or  to give out my information unless I get value in return. 
- I may want to buy gifts from the site or  cookware 
- If I like thte site I might want to  watch videos that demonstrate cooking techniques etc.
- I want to see some information on the website owners so that I can decide if the site is reputable ( Contact information, privacy policy, About us)
- I expect to be able to connect with the social platforms that the brand is using so I can get further reassurance that they are reputable

**As a returning visitor/user to the site:**

- I want to be able to register quickly and give a minimum of personal information
-  I may not want to give my email just to register 
- If I make an error logging in I want to be alerted to my mistake

- If I decide to delete one of my recipes I expect a warning in case I clicked the button accidentally 



#### Strategy

The primary function of the SnixSnax  site is to persuade users that they will receive valuable information in exchange for registering and using the site. If the  user goal is achieved,  the site-owner goal will  be met, that is to have users return many times so they can shop on site  and the site-owner earn commission from advertising.

#### **Scope**

The content and layout of the website is  to establish a means for the site owner to maintain an ongoing connection with users of the website, online ads are effective but a user has to see an advert several times before the site user makes a purchase. 
The SnixSnax recipe Club  encourages users to return frequently - it serves as a recipe repository and allows users to  add their own favourite recipes and to see what other users are adding to the site. 



#### **Structure**

The  Home page for SnixSnax Recipe Club is a simple landing page with a navigation bar and links for the user to Register or Signup to the site or to login if they are already registered.
 It is assumed a user will spend a  short time looking at the content
 The  search bar is prominent on the Home Page so that the user can find recipes quickly and only the most recent recipes that have been submitted are displayed.

A user is likely to spend  time on the site on

-  their Recipe Box page where they can view their collection of recipes 
-   on their Add Recipe Page where they can add recipes .

The monetization of the Home page is important because the user will not spend much time here, so every item must serve some function. - videos are a good way to catch the interest of a user and a selection is presented 




#### **Skeleton**

- Wireframes - [all wireframes] (https://github.com/mr19331/snix-snax/WIREFRAMES.md) 

  

##### **Surface**

The appearance of the site is very important, if the site doesn't appear professional and appealing then the user may not go further and become a  regular user.
 The website is the shop- window for the site owner. 
There has to be a balance between content to attract users to register and use the site regularly and monetization.

## Defensive Design

The following measures were used in the SnixSnax website to  anticipate user error  and minimise the consequences to provide a better user experience on the site, by assisting the user to successful outcomes in the site activities :

**Navigation** 

**Login and Registration**

<u>Blank field submission</u>

Submission of the login or signup form with a blank field  triggers an error message to the user 
Validation is indicated to the user when filling input fields by use of a red ( warning ) or green colored line for the input 

<u>Quality of information submission</u>:

Character type  is controlled for each input field -- only numbers between 0-9 and alphabetical characters are accepted 
the user is informed with  tooltip if unacceptable entries are made. 

Character quantity is controlled for input fields  (5-15 characters)   users cannot enter a one letter username or password. 

**Adding and Editing a recipe** 

Submission of the add recipe or edit recipe form with a blank field  triggers an error message to the user 
Validation is indicated to the user when filling input fields by use of a red ( warning ) or green colored line for the input 

Character type  is controlled for each input field -- only numbers between 0-9 and alphabetical characters are accepted 
the user is informed with  tooltip if unacceptable entries are made. 

Character quantity is controlled for input fields  (5-200 characters)   users cannot enter a recipe that is excessively long. 

**Deleting a recipe**

Accidental deletion of a recipe by a user 
User receives a warning that the deletion cannot be undone and asked whether they wish to proceed 

**Conditional Access to site areas** 

Users state is used to  restrict user access to site areas and activities :

<u>Nav bar links</u> 

Users that are not logged in, have access to signup, login logout and home menu links 
Session users can access home, logout, add a recipe and recipe box links

Admin users can access home, manage categories, add recipe, logout   

<u>Recipe Buttons</u> 

Edit and delete buttons are only displayed to recipe owners

##     Technologies Used

​        CSS

-  The project uses Cascading Style Sheets (*CSS*) as a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to the web documents 

​       HTML 

- The project uses Hypertext Markup Language (**HTML**) which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

​       [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- The project uses Heroku to deploy the site and to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.     

​       [Python + Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 

-  The project uses **Flask** as a lightweight WSGI  ( *Web Server Gateway Interface*) web application framework . Flask includes  Werkzeug and the powerful Jinja templating language and is  one of the most popular *Python* web application frameworks

​       [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- the project uses  MongoDB to store the data required for the project. MongoDB is a noSQL database which stores data in JSON format.

​       [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 

- 

    the project uses MaterializeCSS framework as a source of easy to use elements to  simplify the development process 

    

    [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

    ##Testing   [all testing ](https://github.com/mr19331/snix-snax/blob/master/TESTING.md) 

    ## Defensive Design 
    
    
    
    
    
    ## Security
    
    User Authorization and Authentication
    
    Flask uses Werkzeug for security features and the SnixSnax site makes use of the the standard built – in methods provided
     generate_password_hash  and check_password_hash 
    
     hashing passwords means that a users pw is converted into another string which is one-way and practically impossible to reverse and for additional security it will then salt that string with random data. This provides basic but robust security to protect a users registration information

### **Bugs /Problems during project development**** 

 file app.py Line 64  Linting error  that will not go away 
Linting errors on each template because the doctype is missing 



## Deployment

SnixSnax Recipe Club app used  [Heroku.com](www.heroku.com) for deployment from the development version in GitHub  

The automatic deployment option on Heroku was used as follows :

1. The github repository must be named and Heroku authorized

2. Go to  Heroku settings, and then to Reveal config vars and  enter the  IP, PORT , SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME with values  so that Heroku has access to them.(this is necessary because these variables are hidden in our code and Heroku has to be able to read them) 

3.   Ensure that all files including Procfile and requirements.txt  are pushed to git so  the development version is up to date 

    4.When all updates to GitHub are complete simply click "automatic deployment "

4. [It]() is also possible to use the manual  deployment option and select "master "

5. When the app is deployed  it will say "Your app was successfully deployed" and then you can click view 
    to view the app 

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
