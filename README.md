# Snix-Snax Recipe Club

Snacks  are a staple for lunch-boxes, hikes and TV-time, and now they are important for working from home. Finding snack recipes  and new ideas for snacks, either online or in cookbooks can be time consuming and shop-bought snacks are often full of sugar, artificial colours or additives

. Snix-Snax Recipe Club  provides users with a never-ending flow of new snack ideas and recipes from club members. 

**Users of  the SnixSnax site**  can register to  share their favourite snack recipes, can create, edit and delete their own recipes, and view a library of recipes ( called a Recipe Box) they can  use and store other people's recipes, watch how to videos and buy cookbooks and cooking tools.
The snacks are categorised under several popular headings - Sweet, Savoury, Gluten- Free, Kids and Popular. 

**Owners of the SnixSnax  site** have several opportunities for monetization
Commission can be earned as an amazon.com associate from advertising snack recipe books  or cookware 
Commission can also be earned from adding an ingredient shopping list for popular supermarkets ( Tesco, Ocado Sainsburys) so that users can quickly send a shopping request for the ingredients that they are missing

#### Strategy

The primary function of the SnixSnax  site is to persuade users that they will receive valuable information in exchange for registering and using the site. If the  user goal is achieved,  the site-owner goal will  be met, that is to have users return many times so they can shop on site  and the site-owner earn commission from advertising.

#### **Scope**

The content and layout of the website is  to establish a means for the site owner to maintain an ongoing connection with users of the website, online ads are effective but a user has to see an advert several times before the site user makes a purchase. 
The SnixSnax recipe Club  encourages users to return frequently - it serves as a recipe repository and allows users to  add their own favourite recipes and to see what other users are adding to the site. 



#### **Structure**

The  Home page for SnixSnax Recipe Club is a simple landing page with a navigation bar and links for the user to Register or Signup to the site or to login if they are already registered.
 It is assumed a user will spend a  short time looking at the content
 The  search bar is prominent on the Home Page so that the user can find recipes quickly and only the most recent recipes that have been submitted are displayed.

A user is likely to spend  time on the site on

-  their Recipe Box page where they can view their collection of recipes 
-   on their Add Recipe Page where they can add recipes .

The monetization of the Home page is important because the user will not spend much time here, so every item must serve some function. - videos are a good way to catch the interest of a user and a selection is presented 




#### **Skeleton**

##### **Wireframes**

 [Wireframes](/WIREFRAMES.md)
 Design changes made from the original wireframes. 
 MaterializeCss allows for responsiveness in all versions. 
 The categories
 It was decided to leave all 3 videos in the mobile version - they did not make the page too long and users liked them.  

  

##### **Surface**

The appearance of the site is very important, if the site doesn't appear professional and appealing then the user may not go further and become a  regular user.
 The website is the shop- window for the site owner. 
There has to be a balance between content to attract users to register and use the site regularly and monetization.



## Features



#### Existing Features
**Navbar**   is in the conventional position on all desktop version site pages,contains links that are easy to read, and collapses to a convenient toggle menu icon on mobile version  The mobile and tablet toggle icon opens to a side navbar for users convenient viewing.
Both navbars serve 2 purposes 

1. Display links to the user to easily navigate to the page required to fulfill a function 
   Eg Register or Add A Recipe etc
2. . To control  user access to site pages

Navbar links are different for different user status:

- Unregistered users can see links to  Home Register, Login
- 
  Logged in  users links displayed are   Home, Profile, Add Recipe, Logout
- Admin users navbar links are  Home, Profile, Add Recipe, Manage Categories, Logout

**The Search Bar** with background image is the  first thing that a new user will see on the site. 
The background image is colourful and includes a short text explanation This section allows a new  user to understand what the site is about and try the site without scrolling through the page

User sees exactly what to do and how with minimal effort. Simple instructions, central location and minimal information requirement allows the user to get what they want easily
All users are welcome to use the search function but registered members receive more value.

Text is served in small chunks and images carefully selected for the most impact. 

**Registration Form and Login Form** The registration and login requirements are kept to the minimum for user convenience. Only a username and password are required . Text on the submit button reminds them of the action .A link below each form will return a user to the login page if they have already registered or to the register page, if they try to login without registering first.

- Add a print or email option to the add recipe section so the user can easily print or  share the recipe



## Defensive Design

The following measures were used in the SnixSnax website to  anticipate user error  and minimise the consequences to provide a better user experience on the site, by assisting the user to successful outcomes in the site activities :



**Login and Registration**

<u>Blank field submission</u>

Submission of the login or signup form with a blank field  triggers an error message to the user 
Validation (supplied by Materializecss.com) is indicated to the user when filling input fields by use of a red ( warning ) or green (success) line  

<u>Quality of information submission</u>:

Character type  is controlled for each input field -- only numbers between 0-9 and alphabetical characters are accepted 
the user is informed with  tooltip if unacceptable entries are made. 

Character quantity is controlled for input fields  (5-15 characters)   users cannot enter a one letter username or password. 

<u>Flash Messages</u>:
Successful submission of registration or login triggers a message to the user 
Incorrect entry of password or username triggers a user message without specifying which case
Attempting to use a username that is already in use triggers a similar message 

**Adding and Editing a recipe** 

Submission of the add recipe or edit recipe form with a blank field  triggers an error message to the user 
Validation is indicated to the user when filling input fields by use of a red ( warning ) or green colored line for the input 

<u>Character Type </u>:  is controlled for each input field -- only numbers between 0-9 and alphabetical characters are accepted 
the user is informed with  tooltip if unacceptable entries are made. 

<u>Character Quantity</u> : is controlled for input fields  (5-200 characters)   users cannot enter a recipe that is excessively long.

<u>Cancel action</u>    The edit recipe form has both a  cancel and edit button, in case the user changes their mind.

<u>Buttons</u>: are clearly marked, only one option on add recipe form  to submit 
2 buttons on edit recipe form user can choose to continue with edit or cancel

<u>Flash Message</u>  Users receive a flash message to confirm that their edit was successful and that their recipe was added. 


**Deleting a recipe**

<u>Accidental deletion of a recipe</u> of a recipe by a user 
by a user is avoided by the use of a modal triggered when the user clicks the delete button
User receives a warning that the deletion cannot be undone and asked whether they wish to proceed 
The user can cancel the deletion or proceed 
<u>Flash message</u>  the user is notified with a flash  message when the deletion is confirmed

**Future defensive design to implement** 
Admin login is currently based on username this is not ideal  
A better solution is to adjust admin login to a  key:value pair in users section
This allows for more than one admin login on the team and is more secure.

Salt and hash additions to the username and passwords are currently basic and for more security they should be improved.  
    

##     Technologies Used

​        CSS

-  The project uses Cascading Style Sheets (*CSS*) as a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to the web documents 

​       HTML 

- The project uses Hypertext Markup Language (**HTML**) which is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

​       [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

- The project uses Heroku to deploy the site and to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.     

​       [Python + Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 

-  The project uses **Flask** as a lightweight WSGI  ( *Web Server Gateway Interface*) web application framework . Flask includes  Werkzeug and the powerful Jinja templating language and is  one of the most popular *Python* web application frameworks

​       [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- the project uses  MongoDB to store the data required for the project. MongoDB is a noSQL database which stores data in JSON format.

​       [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 

- 

    the project uses MaterializeCSS framework as a source of easy to use elements to  simplify the development process 

    

    [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


  ### **Testing**

 [Testing](/TESTING.md)   

   
  
    
    ## Security

- ####  Authentication

  Flask uses Werkzeug for security features and the SnixSnax site makes use of the the standard built – in methods provided to secure users' passwords and username details: 
   generate_password_hash  and check_password_hash 

   Hashing passwords converts a user's pw from plain text into another string which is one-way and practically impossible to reverse and for additional security it will then salt that string with random data. 

  This provides basic but robust security to protect a users registration information

   **Authentication**

  <u>Registration</u> Before the data the user types into the registration is added to the database it is checked to make sure that it does not already exist in the database 
  If it does not exist then it is hashed 

  <u>Login</u>

  Users are authenticated on the basis of their registered username and password 

  **Authorization**

​          <u>Nav bar links</u> are conditional on the user state ( all users, session users or admin )
​          Different sections of the website therefore have access protection   

​         This is 
​                   to give those users that have signed up and are logged in  (session users ) a level of exclusivity not available to all users
​                   to encourage users to register  for the site.  
​                  to provide more site security in the case of admin ( only admin are allowed to edit, add or delete categories)

​         **All  Users**  have access to signup, login logout and home menu links 
​         **Session users** can access home, logout, add a recipe and recipe box link
​         **Admin** users can access home, manage categories, add recipe, logout   

<u>  Recipe Buttons</u> 

​       Edit and delete buttons are only displayed to the author of the recipe 


​    



### **Bugs /Problems during project development**** 

 file app.py Line 64  Linting error  that will not go away 
Linting errors on each template because the doctype is missing 

Originally I used a delete confirm dropdown from the browser as part of the defensive design against accidental user deletion.
On my mentor's suggestion I replaced this with the materialize modal instead, to ensure that the functionality was not browser dependent. 

I had a problem on add_recipe.html template with the card-reveal action. The action was originally working but when I added the if statement
 for the session user to the card ,the card-reveal action stopped working . This was resolved with help from Tim the tutor who helped me to rearrange
  the code so that the modal was inside the statement but the card-reveal section outside. 



## Deployment

SnixSnax Recipe Club app used  [Heroku.com](www.heroku.com) for deployment from the development version in GitHub  

The automatic deployment option on Heroku was used as follows :

1. The github repository must be named and Heroku authorized

2. Go to  Heroku settings, and then to Reveal config vars and  enter the  IP, PORT , SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME with values  so that Heroku has access to them.(this is necessary because these variables are hidden in our code and Heroku has to be able to read them) 

3.   Ensure that all files including Procfile and requirements.txt  are pushed to git so  the development version is up to date 

    4.When all updates to GitHub are complete simply click "automatic deployment "

4. [It]() is also possible to use the manual  deployment option and select "master "

5. When the app is deployed  it will say "Your app was successfully deployed" and then you can click view 
    to view the app
